# DataIncubatorSpring2021
### Data Incubator Project Proposal 

The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics conduct monthly surveys to collect data on income, education and employment across the population. It is one of the oldest and largest surveys in the United States for data on labor statistics. There are only a few datasets that capture information relating to small business ownership in the U.S. but they all have a lag in publishing their results.The Current Population Survey (CPS) data is unique in that the microdata is released within a month from the week of the survey, thus providing information on recent developments. 

Considering data from Dec 2019 to June 2020, it can be seen that small business owners have been directly impacted as a result of COVID-19 and the resulting social distancing rules. The analysis shows that immediately following the announcement of the global pandemic from the WHO in March 2020 there was a significant drop in the number of small business ownerships which had remained steady in the preceding months, as shown in the plot attached.
The CPS data also collects information on 
 - Education levels
 - Race
 - Sex
 - Nationality 
 
and other demographics on the survey population. This can be used to study change in business ownership on the basis of Race, Sex, education level of owner or nationality of owner. By looking at the change for different demographic groups we can check to see if certain groups were affected more adversely than others. These parameters can be tracked over time to contrast recovery within these demographic groups to observe a  granular view of the economy and long-term unemployment trends. In an industrial context, such data may be useful to revise risk models for financial lenders and corporations. In addition, it may be possible to correlate these data with loan and grant disbursement pre and post COVID to identify trends in economic relief options based on our parameters and contrast with trends in business closures analyzed using the CPS dataset to achieve a holistic look at the recovering economy post-COVID.
